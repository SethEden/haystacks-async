 * @NOTE This function isn't actually working, because in the haystacks code base we've
 * always set the D-data structure data on the D-object itself never on the D['data'] field.
 * So an extra special effort will need to be made to refactor the data interface again and make it work via an actual interface.
 * Instead of a hard-coded data endpoint in the code.
 * This will be a good pre-emptive step to implementing a Red-Black Binary Search Tree.
 * Because once all the data is flowing through a data interface, then we can swap out that interface for a newer faster one based on RB-BST.
 * @UPDATE Actually this function IS THE ONLY WAY this works! Setting the data on the D-object itself fails in every way.
 * I've even tried to update to node v18 and use the structuredClone function, which also didn't work.
 * But the code below DOES WORK! Don't touch it unless you want to break the loading of all plugins.
 * We can review this when we get past a production MVP release.
 * @NOTE Attempting to create/refactor for a new data interface could cause a cascade performance regression,
 * that is the last thing we want to be dealing with at this late stage in the game.
 * Perhaps we will have to wait until after a GUI system is developed, then take on this data/data-interface re-architecture and RB-BST effort all at once.
